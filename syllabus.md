Syllabus for Do LLMs Generalize? (CMSC 35900, Autumn 2024)
===========================

## Course description and goals

LLMs do some amazing things. Is that because they're copying behavior from something they've already seen or because they're genuinely extrapolating in the right direction? And how would we tell the difference?

## Approach

We will have two lectures per week and each student is expected to present (lead the discussion) once in class. If there are too many students, then you can team-up. No more than 2 students per presentation.

### Required background

Mathematical background:
Linear algebra, probability, calculus, and statistics. Students are expected to have basic knowledge about machine learning, deep learning, and langauge models. Some hands-on experience with these is useful.


### Course evaluation

You need to present once and participate in over 80% of the lectures to pass. Attendence will be taken—the entire class is about discussing the issues of the day as informed by our reading and our discussion leaders—if you don't participate then there is no class.

### Late policy

We do not allow for any late submissions—in fact we don't have submissions at all. Show-up, present, and discuss. Relax.

##  Course policies

### Policy on academic honesty

We take academic honesty very seriously in this class. Please make sure to read the [UChicago Academic Honesty page](http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct). For code-related policies, we will follow the same [policy](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2020/fall/12100-1/honesty.html) as CS 121.

### Diversity statement
The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, or preferred gender pronouns you would like us to use, please let us know.
